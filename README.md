## Install

Make sure you have the recommended `node` and `npm` versions in this README. If everything is correct run this command on your terminal:

`$ npm install --i`

Make sure you have `MongoDB` installed and that your service is active, so edit the `variables.env.sample` file and save it to the root named `variables.env` with your database settings.


## Using

Make sure you have installed all the dependencies. In the project root type:

`$ node app`

## Optional

If you do not want to run the `node` command at all times, install the `nodemon`:

`$ npm install --g nodemon`

## Result

If everything goes well you will have this result in your terminal:

`➡➡➡ The server is online: http://localhost:8080/ ☻`
